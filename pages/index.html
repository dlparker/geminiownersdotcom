Provides a messaging function with email integration and good search tools, a collaborative wiki, storage for photos and files with good search tools. Started in 2019 by some of the same owners that use other groups.</li>

                    <li><h3>Facebook</h3> - Restricted access for owners (and selected others?). Found by logging in to Facebook and searching for the group. I can't find a way to link to the group without being logged into Facebook, so you'll have to find it yourself. Started in 2013 by some of the owners from the Yahoo! group</li>
